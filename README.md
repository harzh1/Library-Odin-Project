This is a book library app that allows users to add, remove, and display books.
This project is a book library app that allows users to add, remove, and display books. The app is built using HTML and JavaScript. The user can add a new book by clicking on the "NEW BOOK" button and filling out the form with the book's details. The app stores all of the book objects in an array and displays them on the page. Each book can be removed from the library by clicking on the "Remove" button. Additionally, there is a button on each book's display that toggles its read status.
